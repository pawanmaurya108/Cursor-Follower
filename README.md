# Cursor-Follower
A simple web-based project created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that contains a cursor-following ball. As the user moves their mouse across the screen, a ball dynamically follows the cursor, offering an interactive and engaging visual experience. This project demonstrates the use of DOM manipulation and JavaScript event handling to create smooth, real-time interactions.
